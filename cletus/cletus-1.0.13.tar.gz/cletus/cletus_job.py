""" Used to ensure that only one job runs at a time.

    Cletus_job is highly opinionated about how to ensure only one job
    at a time runs, when that's important.
       - Applications should be able to wait for some amount of time for
         the older instance to complete.
       - Just checking on a pid in a file isn't enough: that pid might be
         orphaned, and you can easily get race conditions.
       - When a file system becomes full, a pidfile could be cataloged,
         but no pid can be written to it.  This needs to be handled.

    So cletus_job's objective is to make it extremely easy for most apps to
    handle this problem.

    Typical Usage:

        if job_check.lock_pidfile():
            print 'Lock acquired, will start processing'

        job_check.close()

    Inputs:
        app_name (str) - Used for two purposes: to lookup pid directory based on xdg
                         standards, and to name pid file.  Lookup only occurs if the
                         pid_dir is not provided.  Defaults to 'main'.
        log_name (str) - Should be passed from caller in order to ensure logging
                         characteristics are inherited correctly.  Defaults to __main__.
        pid_dir (str)  - Can be used instead of the automatic XDG directory
                         user_cache_dir, which is useful for testing among other things.
                         Defaults to None - which is fine as long as app_name is provided.

    Raises:
        ValueError   - Neither app_name nor pid_dir was provided, one must be
        OSError      - Could not create pid dir and it didn't already exist
