"""Module that implements ``RefResolver`` factory using ``JSONResolver``.

The ``ref_resolver_factory`` uses an instance of ``JSONResolver`` for
implementation of remote URL resolver. The resolver is used to retrieve JSON
object based on registered plugins.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from jsonschema import validate
   >>> from jsonresolver import JSONResolver
   >>> from jsonresolver.contrib.jsonschema import ref_resolver_factory
   >>> schema = {'$ref': 'http://localhost:4000/schema/authors.json#'}
   >>> json_resolver = JSONResolver(plugins=['demo.schema'])
   >>> resolver_cls = ref_resolver_factory(json_resolver)
   >>> resolver = resolver_cls.from_schema(schema)
   >>> validate(['foo', 'bar'], schema, resolver=resolver)
   None
